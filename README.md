# Advent_of_Code_2025

## Warning

I am not a professional programmer. Coding is a hobby for me, and I only have experience with basic PHP, HTML, MySQL, and JavaScript.  
Please don’t judge my slightly chaotic code too harshly.

You don't know what Advent of Code is? Check out their [About page](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about)!

## Languages used

Since I’m still learning JavaScript, I decided to do this challenge in JS to get a better grasp of the language.

---

## Tools used

- Official documentation (to understand how things work)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (for quick language-specific questions)

---

## Why do this?

- Because it’s a fun challenge  
- To improve my coding skills  
- To help me with my own personal projects (current or upcoming)
